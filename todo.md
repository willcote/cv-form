- [x] change userInfo to a array for map (or a hashmap, with key as the order that I want to print info in???)
- [ ] userInfo to hashmap of form: [id: {}}

change userInfo to array of objects with predefined locations

ex: name should change index 0

[{label, value}, {label, value}]

Init array with 10 spots, undefined so it can be iterated over even when all the fields aren't filled.

change lockform to expect an array instead of a map
